Warning (20028): Parallel compilation is not licensed and has been disabled
Info (119006): Selected device 5CEBA4F23C7 for design "top"
Info (21076): High junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '85'.
Info (21076): Low junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '0'.
Info (171003): Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Warning (292013): Feature LogicLock is only available with a valid subscription license. You can purchase a software subscription to gain full access to this feature.
Warning (15714): Some pins have incomplete I/O assignments. Refer to the I/O Assignment Warnings report for details

Info (176233): Starting register packing
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'top.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332144): No user constrained base clocks found in the design
Info (332143): No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info (332123): Deriving Clock Uncertainty. Please refer to report_sdc in TimeQuest to see clock uncertainties.
Info (332130): Timing requirements not specified -- quality metrics such as performance may be sacrificed to reduce compilation time.
Info (176235): Finished register packing
    Extra Info (176218): Packed 48 registers into blocks of type DSP block
    Extra Info (176220): Created 16 register duplicates

Info (170195): Router estimated average interconnect usage is 0% of the available device resources
    Info (170196): Router estimated peak interconnect usage is 3% of the available device resources in the region that extends from location X11_Y0 to location X21_Y10
Info (170199): The Fitter performed an Auto Fit compilation.  Optimizations were skipped to reduce compilation time.
    Info (170201): Optimizations that may affect the design's routability were skipped
